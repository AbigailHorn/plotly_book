(ref:shiny-drill-down) Using a drill-down approach to navigating through sales data by category, sub-category, and order date. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/307597838>"`

(ref:shiny-crossfilter-naive) A 'naive' crossfilter implementation linking arrival time with departure time of about 350,000 `flights` from the **nycflights13** package. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/318277110>"`

(ref:shiny-crossfilter-kde) Using kernel density estimation to responsively crossfilter a 2D distribution. This particular example shows how the relationship between diamond carat and price is dependent upon it's depth. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/318122403>"`

(ref:shiny-crossfilter) Crossfiltering 6 variables in the `flights` data from the **nycflights13** package [@nycflights13]. The filtering and binning logic occurs server-side resulting in a very minimal amount of data being sent between server and client (just the brush range and bar heights). Moreover, to perform the UI update, the client only has to tweak existing bar heights, so the overall user experience is quite responsive. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/318129502>"`

(ref:shiny-crossfilter-compare) Comparing filters with a dynamic color brush. This particular example compares 'red eye' flights (in green) to early morning flights (in orange). This makes it easier to see that delays occur more often for 'red eye' flights. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/327622610>"`

(ref:shiny-drag-brush) A draggable brush with both a transient and persistent mode. The dragging ability is done by mimicing the native plotly.js brush with an editable rectangle shape and listening to changes in that brush. The implementation of transient vs persistent mode is a matter of forgetting or remembering previous state(s) of the brush. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/318330112>"`

(ref:shiny-crosstalk-examples) Example of a **shiny** app that has **crosstalk** functionality embedded. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/207379729>"`

(ref:console-log) Using `htmlwidgets::onRender()` to inspect the relevant DOM instance containing the **plotly** graph and information related to it's current display. The `_fullData` and `_fullLayout` attributes bound to the element are 'internal' (meaning relying on this information in production code is discouraged), but do provide a useful description of the chart's current state, especially if you need access to computations done by plotly.js (e.g., axis tick placement). `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/307598574>"`

(ref:console-log-event) Inspecting event data for hover, click, and selected events. If a click or hover event does not derive from a statistical aggregation (e.g., boxplot, histogram, etc), the `points` array is of length 1; otherwise, the length corresponds to how many input values are represented in the selection. In Chrome, when you log an object to the console, you can click on a link to the JS source function where you can then set breakpoints. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/307597974>"`

(ref:tx-annotate) Combining the graphical querying framework from \@ref(graphical-queries) with a custom JS event handler to highlight a time series as well as circling the month selected. This example supplies a list-column to `customdata` in order to populate an informative title based on the user's selection of city and month. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/307597956>"`

(ref:tx-mean-sales) Displaying the average monthly sales for a city of interest on hover. This implementation supplies all the raw sales figures, then uses the hovered `customdata` value to query sales for the given city and display the average. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/307598016>"`

(ref:tx-inset-plot) Adding another event handler to Figure \@ref(fig:tx-annotate) to draw an inset plot showing the distribution of monthly house sales. `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) "For a video demonstration of the interactive, see <https://vimeo.com/307598624>"`
