(ref:intro-defaults) Three examples of visualizing categorical data with `plot_ly()`: (top) mapping `cut` to `x` yields a bar chart, (middle) mapping `cut` & `clarity` to `x` & `y` yields a heatmap, and (c) mapping `cut` & `clarity` to `x` & `color` yields a dodged bar chart.

(ref:shiny-crossfilter) Crossfiltering 6 variables in the `flights` data from the **nycflights13** package [@nycflights13]. The filtering and binning logic occurs server-side resulting in a very minimal amount of data being sent between server and client (just the brush range and bar heights). Moreover, to perform the UI update, the client only has to tweak existing bar heights, so the overall user experience is quite responsive.

The dragging ability is done by mimicing the native plotly.js brush with an editable rectangle shape and listening to changes in that brush.
