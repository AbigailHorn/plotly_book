# Animating views

```{block, type='rmdwarning'}
The code is this section is still under development and is likely to change.
To run any of the code you see in this section, you'll need this developmental version of the package:
`devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly#741")`
```

Both `plot_ly()` and `ggplotly()` understand a `frame` aesthetic. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(gapminder, package = "gapminder")
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, 
                           color = continent, frame = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()

ggplotly(p)
```


IDEAS:
  * Grand tour
  * Demonstrate high variance in density estimation via binning (i.e., same data and different anchor points for the bins can result in very different values for the binned frequencies)
