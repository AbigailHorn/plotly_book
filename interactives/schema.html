An {array} of data. The value MUST be an {array}, or we ignore it. Note that typed arrays (e.g. Float32Array) are supported.
dflt
Enumerated value type. The available values are listed in `values`.
values
dflt
A boolean (true/false) value.
dflt
A number or a numeric value (e.g. a number inside a string). When applicable, values greater (less) than `max` (`min`) are coerced to the `dflt`.
dflt
An integer or an integer inside a string. When applicable, values greater (less) than `max` (`min`) are coerced to the `dflt`.
dflt
A string value. Numbers are converted to strings except for attributes with `strict` set to true.
dflt
A string describing color. Supported formats: - hex (e.g. '#d3d3d3') - rgb (e.g. 'rgb(255, 0, 0)') - rgba (e.g. 'rgb(255, 0, 0, 0.5)') - hsl (e.g. 'hsl(0, 100%, 50%)') - hsv (e.g. 'hsv(0, 100%, 100%)') - named colors (full list: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color)
dflt
A list of colors. Must be an {array} containing valid colors.
dflt
A Plotly colorscale either picked by a name: (any of Greys, YlGnBu, Greens, YlOrRd, Bluered, RdBu, Reds, Blues, Picnic, Rainbow, Portland, Jet, Hot, Blackbody, Earth, Electric, Viridis, Cividis ) customized as an {array} of 2-element {arrays} where the first element is the normalized color level value (starting at *0* and ending at *1*), and the second item is a valid color string.
dflt
A number (in degree) between -180 and 180.
dflt
An id string of a subplot type (given by dflt), optionally followed by an integer &gt;1. e.g. if dflt='geo', we can have 'geo', 'geo2', 'geo3', ...
dflt
regex
A string representing a combination of flags (order does not matter here). Combine any of the available `flags` with *+*. (e.g. ('lines+markers')). Values in `extras` cannot be combined.

trace attributes should include an `editType` string matching this flaglist. *calc* is the most extensive: a full `Plotly.plot` starting by clearing `gd.calcdata` to force it to be regenerated *clearAxisTypes* resets the types of the axes this trace is on, because new data could cause the automatic axis type detection to change. Log type will not be cleared, as that is never automatically chosen so must have been user-specified. *plot* calls `Plotly.plot` but without first clearing `gd.calcdata`. *style* only calls `module.style` (or module.editStyle) for all trace modules and redraws the legend. *markerSize* is like *style*, but propagate axis-range changes due to scatter `marker.size` *colorbars* only redraws colorbars.

calc
layout attributes should include an `editType` string matching this flaglist. *calc* is the most extensive: a full `Plotly.plot` starting by clearing `gd.calcdata` to force it to be regenerated *plot* calls `Plotly.plot` but without first clearing `gd.calcdata`. *legend* only redraws the legend. *ticks* only redraws axis ticks, labels, and gridlines. *axrange* minimal sequence when updating axis ranges. *layoutstyle* reapplies global and SVG cartesian axis styles. *modebar* just updates the modebar. *camera* just updates the camera settings for gl3d scenes. *arraydraw* allows component arrays to invoke the redraw routines just for the component(s) that changed.
Sometimes when an attribute is changed, other attributes must be altered as well in order to achieve the intended result. For example, when `range` is specified, it is important to set `autorange` to `false` or the new `range` value would be lost in the redraw. `impliedEdits` is the mechanism to do this: `impliedEdits: {autorange: false}`. Each key is a relative paths to the attribute string to change, using *^* to ascend into the parent container, for example `range[0]` has `impliedEdits: {*^autorange*: false}`. A value of `undefined` means that the attribute will not be changed, but its previous value should be recorded in case we want to reverse this change later. For example, `autorange` has `impliedEdits: {*range[0]*: undefined, *range[1]*:undefined} because the range will likely be changed by redraw.
The scatter trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts, text charts, and bubble charts. The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `x` and `y`. Text (appearing either on the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to numerical arrays.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or their x values if `orientation` is *h*). If blank or omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also turns `fill` on by default, using *tonexty* (*tonextx*) if `orientation` is *h* (*v*) and sets the default `mode` to *lines* irrespective of point count. You can only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.

Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be used - including if `visible` is *legendonly* but not if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of this `stackgroup`. With *fraction*, the value of each trace at each location is divided by the sum of all trace values at that location. *percent* is the same but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.

See https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;".

Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style
colorbars
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

The data that describes the heatmap value-to-color mapping is set in `z`. Data in `z` can either be a {2D array} of values (ragged or not) or a 1D array of values. In the case where `z` is a {2D array}, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then, by default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along the y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words, the i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot) and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`. Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1) elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D {array}, the x and y coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to form data triplets.

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

If *percent* / *probability*, the span of each bar corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences with respect to the total number of sample points (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If *density*, the span of each bar corresponds to the number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals the total number of sample points).

For category data, `start` is based on the category serial numbers, and defaults to -0.5.

At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style
colorbars
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Sets the starting value for the x axis bins. Defaults to the minimum data value, shifted down if necessary to make nice round values and to remove ambiguous bin edges. For example, if most of the data is integers we shift the bin edges 0.5 down, so a `size` of 5 would have a default `start` of -0.5, so it is clear that 0-4 are in the first bin, 5-9 in the second, but continuous data gets a start of 0 and bins [0,5), [5,10) etc. Dates behave similarly, and `start` should be a date string. For category data, `start` is based on the category serial numbers, and defaults to -0.5.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Sets the starting value for the x axis bins. Defaults to the minimum data value, shifted down if necessary to make nice round values and to remove ambiguous bin edges. For example, if most of the data is integers we shift the bin edges 0.5 down, so a `size` of 5 would have a default `start` of -0.5, so it is clear that 0-4 are in the first bin, 5-9 in the second, but continuous data gets a start of 0 and bins [0,5), [5,10) etc. Dates behave similarly, and `start` should be a date string.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

info
calc
Sets the tick mode for this axis. If *auto*, the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If *linear*, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (*linear* is the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If *array*, the placement of the ticks is set via `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (*array* is the default value if `tickvals` is provided).

linear
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when `dtick`=*L&lt;f&gt;* (see `dtick` for more info). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style
calc
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

See https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.

Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

calc
Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived from the set of vertices (points) represented by the `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If *-1*, Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at more than one point it will result triangles that are very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If *&gt;0*, the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the parameter for the mesh fitting. If *0*,  the convex-hull algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y` and `z` point set into a convex hull.

FALSE
Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

FALSE
Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Sets the tick mode for this axis. If *auto*, the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If *linear*, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (*linear* is the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If *array*, the placement of the ticks is set via `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (*array* is the default value if `tickvals` is provided).

linear
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when `dtick`=*L&lt;f&gt;* (see `dtick` for more info). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style
colorbars
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes.

To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

colorbars
Sets the tick mode for this axis. If *auto*, the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If *linear*, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (*linear* is the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If *array*, the placement of the ticks is set via `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (*array* is the default value if `tickvals` is provided).

linear
Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when `dtick`=*L&lt;f&gt;* (see `dtick` for more info). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style
colorbars
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided.

The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.

FALSE
Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style
colorbars
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

calc
A sequential value, 0..n, supply it to avoid creating this array inside plotting. If specified, it must be a typed `Int32Array` array. Its length must be equal to or greater than the number of points. For the best performance and memory use, create one large `indices` typed array that is guaranteed to be at least as long as the largest number of points during use, and reuse it on each `Plotly.restyle()` call.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided.

Sets the tick mode for this axis. If *auto*, the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If *linear*, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (*linear* is the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when `dtick`=*L&lt;f&gt;* (see `dtick` for more info). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style
calc
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

See https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `value` and `label`. Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;".

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with `fillcolor` if not *none*. scatterternary has a subset of the options available to scatter. *toself* connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext* fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like *toself* if there is no trace before it. *tonext* should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

The candlestick is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The boxes represent the spread between the `open` and `close` values and the lines represent the spread between the `low` and `high` values Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing candles are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

calc
FALSE
Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in `marker.color`is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use`marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrRd,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,Hot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
boolean

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any
style
calc
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

If provided, a changed value tells `Plotly.react` that one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete new copy for an incremental change.

Used to allow user interactions with the plot to persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if it is given and it changed from the previous `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any attribute that has been affected by user interactions and did not receive a different value in the new figure will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision` attribute serves as the default for `uirevision` attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example, if your app separately controls the data on the x and y axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*` and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range will retain any user-driven zoom.

Default attributes to be applied to the plot. Templates can be created from existing plots using `Plotly.makeTemplate`, or created manually. They should be objects with format: `{layout: layoutTemplate, data: {[type]: [traceTemplate, ...]}, ...}` `layoutTemplate` and `traceTemplate` are objects matching the attribute structure of `layout` and a data trace.  Trace templates are applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`) is applied to each array item. But if an item has a `templateitemname` key we look in the template array for an item with matching `name` and apply that instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the item invisible. Any named template item not referenced is appended to the end of the array, so you can use this for a watermark annotation or a logo image, for example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible: false`.

The *select* flag enables selecting single data points via click. This mode also supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an existing selection. *select* with `hovermode`: *x* can be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`: *closest* when using this feature.

plot
If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range of this axis changes together with the range of the corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain` and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis: {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`. Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently forbidden.

If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

If set to another axis id (e.g. `x2`, `y`), the range of this axis changes together with the range of the corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. `constrain` and `constraintoward` determine how we enforce the constraint. You can chain these, ie `yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: *y*}` but you can only link axes of the same `type`. The linked axis can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across subplots). Loops (`yaxis: {scaleanchor: *x*}, xaxis: {scaleanchor: *y*}` or longer) are redundant and the last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid possible inconsistent constraints via `scaleratio`. Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a `scaleanchor` and a `matches` constraint is currently forbidden.

If this axis is linked to another by `scaleanchor`, this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio.

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes.

To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when `dtick`=*L&lt;f&gt;* (see `dtick` for more info). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

plot
Sets the tick mode for this axis. If *auto*, the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If *linear*, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (*linear* is the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If *array*, the placement of the ticks is set via `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (*array* is the default value if `tickvals` is provided).

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when `dtick`=*L&lt;f&gt;* (see `dtick` for more info). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.
any

plot
linear
Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes.

To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L&lt;f&gt;*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M&lt;n&gt;* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

For `type` *path* - a valid SVG path with the pixel values replaced by data values in `xsizemode`/`ysizemode` being *scaled* and taken unmodified as pixels relative to `xanchor` and `yanchor` in case of *pixel* size mode. There are a few restrictions / quirks only absolute instructions, not relative. So the allowed segments are: M, L, H, V, Q, C, T, S, and Z arcs (A) are not allowed because radius rx and ry are relative. In the future we could consider supporting relative commands, but we would have to decide on how to handle date and log axes. Note that even as is, Q and C Bezier paths that are smooth on linear axes may not be smooth on log, and vice versa. no chained "polybezier" commands - specify the segment type for each one. On category axes, values are numbers scaled to the serial numbers of categories because using the categories themselves there would be no way to describe fractional positions On data axes: because space and T are both normal components of path strings, we can't use either to separate date from time parts. Therefore we'll use underscore for this purpose: 2015-02-21_13:45:56.789

Invalid values are ignored, so for example in *avg* they do not contribute to either the numerator or the denominator. Any data type (numeric, date, category) may be aggregated with any function, even though in certain cases it is unlikely to make sense, for example a sum of dates or average of categories. *median* will return the average of the two central values if there is an even count. *mode* will return the first value to reach the maximum count, in case of a tie. *change* will return the difference between the first and last linked values. *range* will return the difference between the min and max linked values.

FALSE
Enables moving shapes.
boolean
FALSE
Enables editing the global layout title.
object
boolean
FALSE
Determines whether the graphs are plotted with respect to layout.autosize:true and infer its container size.
boolean
FALSE
Determines whether to change the layout size when window is resized. In v2, this option will be removed and will always be true.
boolean
FALSE
When `layout.autosize` is turned on, determines whether the graph fills the container (the default) or the screen (if set to *true*).
number
0
0
0.5
When `layout.autosize` is turned on, set the frame margins in fraction of the graph size.
flaglist
cartesian
TRUE
gl3d+geo+mapbox
Determines whether mouse wheel or two-finger scroll zooms is enable. Turned on by default for gl3d, geo and mapbox subplots (as these subplot types do not have zoombox via pan), but turned off by default for cartesian subplots. Set `scrollZoom` to *false* to disable scrolling for all subplots.
enumerated
FALSE
reset+autosize
Sets the double click interaction mode. Has an effect only in cartesian plots. If *false*, double click is disable. If *reset*, double click resets the axis ranges to their initial values. If *autosize*, double click set the axis ranges to their autorange values. If *reset+autosize*, the odd double clicks resets the axis ranges to their initial values and even double clicks set the axis ranges to their autorange values.
boolean
TRUE
Set to *false* to omit cartesian axis pan/zoom drag handles.
boolean
TRUE
Set to *false* to omit direct range entry at the pan/zoom drag points, note that `showAxisDragHandles` must be enabled to have an effect.
boolean
TRUE
Determines whether or not tips are shown while interacting with the resulting graphs.
boolean
FALSE
Determines whether a link to plot.ly is displayed at the bottom right corner of resulting graphs. Use with `sendData` and `linkText`.
string
Edit chart
TRUE
Sets the text appearing in the `showLink` link.
boolean
TRUE
If *showLink* is true, does it contain data just link to a plot.ly file?
any
FALSE
Adds a source-displaying function to show sources on the resulting graphs.
enumerated
hover
hover
Determines the mode bar display mode. If *true*, the mode bar is always visible. If *false*, the mode bar is always hidden. If *hover*, the mode bar is visible while the mouse cursor is on the graph container.
boolean
FALSE
Should we include a ModeBar button, labeled "Edit in Chart Studio", that sends this chart to plot.ly or another plotly server as specified by `plotlyServerURL` for editing, export, etc? Prior to version 1.43.0 this button was included by default, now it is opt-in using this flag. Note that this button can (depending on `plotlyServerURL`) send your data to an external server. However that server does not persist your data until you arrive at the Chart Studio and explicitly click "Save".
any
Remove mode bar buttons by name. See ./components/modebar/buttons.js for the list of names.
any
Add mode bar button using config objects See ./components/modebar/buttons.js for list of arguments.
any
FALSE
Define fully custom mode bar buttons as nested array, where the outer arrays represents button groups, and the inner arrays have buttons config objects or names of default buttons See ./components/modebar/buttons.js for more info.
any
Statically override options for toImage modebar button allowed keys are format, filename, width, height, scale see ../components/modebar/buttons.js
boolean
TRUE
Determines whether or not the plotly logo is displayed on the end of the mode bar.
boolean
FALSE
watermark the images with the company's logo
number
2

4
Set the pixel ratio during WebGL image export. This config option was formerly named `plot3dPixelRatio` which is now deprecated.
any
transparent
Set function to add the background color (i.e. `layout.paper_color`) to a different container. This function take the graph div as first argument and the current background color as second argument. Alternatively, set to string *opaque* to ensure there is white behind it.
string
TRUE
https://cdn.plot.ly/
Set the URL to topojson used in geo charts. By default, the topojson files are fetched from cdn.plot.ly. For example, set this option to: &lt;path-to-plotly.js&gt;/dist/topojson/ to render geographical feature using the topojson files that ship with the plotly.js module.
string
Mapbox access token (required to plot mapbox trace types) If using an Mapbox Atlas server, set this option to '' so that plotly.js won't attempt to authenticate to the public Mapbox server.
boolean
1
Turn all console logging on or off (errors will be thrown) This should ONLY be set via Plotly.setPlotConfig Available levels: 0: no logs 1: warnings and errors, but not informational messages 2: verbose logs
integer
0
0
Sets the length of the undo/redo queue.
any
Set global transform to be applied to all traces with no specification needed
string
en-US
Which localization should we use? Should be a string like 'en' or 'en-US'.
any
Localization definitions Locales can be provided either here (specific to one chart) or globally by registering them as modules. Should be an object of objects {locale: {dictionary: {...}, format: {...}}} {   da: {       dictionary: {'Reset axes': 'Nulstil aksler', ...},       format: {months: [...], shortMonths: [...]}   },   ... } All parts are optional. When looking for translation or format fields, we look first for an exact match in a config locale, then in a registered module. If those fail, we strip off any regionalization ('en-US' -&gt; 'en') and try each (config, registry) again. The final fallback for translation is untranslated (which is US English) and for formats is the base English (the only consequence being the last fallback date format %x is DD/MM/YYYY instead of MM/DD/YYYY). Currently `grouping` and `currency` are ignored for our automatic number formatting, but can be used in custom formats.
