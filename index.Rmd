# Overview {-}

This website explains and partially documents the R package **plotly**, a high-level interface to the open source JavaScript graphing library [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) (which powers [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/)). The R package already has numerous examples and documentation on <https://plot.ly/r> and <https://plot.ly/ggplot2>, but this website provides more of a cohesive narrative to help explain fundamental concepts and recent developments. By reading from start to finish, readers new to R and plotly should be able to get up and running fairly quickly. That being said, advanced R and plotly users should still find the majority of this material useful and informative. I highly recommend copying/pasting examples into your R console, and modifying them as you read along, to aid the learning process.

## Installation {-}

If you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) installed, you can install the stable release of **plotly** by typing this in your R console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("plotly")
```

Or you can install the development release via the devtools package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
```

## Get started {-}

To ensure plotly is installed correctly, try loading the package and creating this example by pasting the code inside your R console.

```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(z = ~volcano)
```

```{block, type='rmdtip'}
**plotly** uses the [htmlwidget](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) framework, which allows plots to work seamlessly and consistently in various contexts (e.g., R Markdown documents, shiny apps, inside RStudio, or any other R command prompt) without an internet connection. IPython/Jupyter notebook users should wrap plots with the `embed_notebook()` function to embed them inline inside a notebook.
```

## plot.ly for collaboration (optional) {-}

[plot.ly](https://plot.ly/) subscribers can use `plotly_POST()` to host graphs on a plotly account. This is mainly useful for sharing plots, and allowing your collaborators to view/fork/modify them using a friendly user-interface. 

```r
p <- plot_ly(z = ~volcano, type = "surface")
plotly_POST(p, filename = "Volcano surface")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://i.imgur.com/T2g1pQB.gif")
```

```{block, type='rmdtip'}
As long as you can view a plot hosted on <http://plot.ly>, you can obtain the data behind with plot via the `get_figure()` function. This makes it easy to access and modify plots created with _any_ plotly.js interface (e.g., Python, MATLAB, Julia, Scala, etc) from your R console.
```

With a free account (use the `signup()` function to get one), you can create and share public plots. If you need privacy or customer support, have a look at the [pricing options](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/). If you're account has support for private graphs, it's simple to make them private with `plotly_POST()`

```r
plotly_POST(p, sharing = "private")
```
