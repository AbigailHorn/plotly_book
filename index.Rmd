This book teaches you how to create interactive and dynamic web graphics using the R packages **plotly** and **shiny**. The majority of the book uses R code examples to demonstrate features and functionality available in **plotly**.^[All the software tools in this book are 100% free and open source. Many people think the R package **plotly** is not free and open-source, but both the R package and the JavaScript library it depends on (plotly.js) are MIT-licensed.] Along the way, you'll also learn about other R tools (e.g., **tidyverse** packages) that help make **plotly** such a productive tool for both exploratory analysis and presentation of your data. In addition to data visualization principles, you'll also learn some effective strategies for graphical exploration of high-dimensional data. By mastering these concepts and tools, you'll impress your colleagues with your ability to generate *more* graphical insights *faster* via highly interactive graphics that you can share over email, export to pdf, and more.
