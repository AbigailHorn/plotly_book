# (PART) Combining multiple views {-}

# Arranging views

One technique essential to high-dimensional data visualization is the ability to arrange multiple views. By arranging multiple low-dimensional graphics of the same (or similar) high-dimensional data, one can put 
local summaries and patterns into a global context. When arranging multiple **plotly** objects, you have some flexibility in terms of how you arrange them: you could use `subplot()` to merge multiple **plotly** object into a single object (useful for synchronizing zoom&pan events across multiple axes), place them in separate HTML tags (Section \@ref(arranging-htmlwidgets)), or embedded in a larger system for navigating many views (Section \@ref(navigating-many-views)).

Ideally, when displaying multiple related data views, they are linked through an underlying data source to foster comparisons and enable posing of data queries [@Cook:2007uk]. Chapter \@ref(graphical-queries) shows how to build upon these methods for arranging views to link them (client-side) as well.

## Arranging plotly objects

The `subplot()` function provides a flexible interface for merging multiple **plotly** objects into a single object. It is more flexible than most trellis display frameworks (e.g., **ggplot2**'s `facet_wrap()`) as you don't have to condition on a value of common variable in each display [@trellis]. Its capabilities and interface is similar to the `grid.arrange()` function from the **gridExtra** package, which allows you to arrange multiple **grid** grobs in a single view, effectively providing a way to arrange (possibly unrelated)  **ggplot2** and/or **lattice** plots in a single view [@RCore]; [@gridExtra]; [@lattice]. Figure \@ref(fig:subplot-simple) shows the most simple way to use `subplot()` which is to directly supply plotly objects.

```r
library(plotly)
p1 <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy) %>% 
  add_lines(name = "unemploy")
p2 <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~uempmed) %>% 
  add_lines(name = "uempmed")
subplot(p1, p2)
```

```{r subplot-simple, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The most basic use of `subplot()` to merge multiple plotly objects into a single plotly object."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/subplot-simple.svg")
```

Although `subplot()` accepts an arbitrary number of plot objects, passing a _list_ of plots can save typing and redundant code when dealing with a large number of plots. Figure \@ref(fig:economics) shows one time series for each variable in the `economics` dataset and share the x-axis so that zoom/pan events are synchronized across each series:

```r
vars <- setdiff(names(economics), "date")
plots <- lapply(vars, function(var) {
  plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = as.formula(paste0("~", var))) %>%
    add_lines(name = var)
})
subplot(plots, nrows = length(plots), shareX = TRUE, titleX = FALSE)
```

```{r economics, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Five different economic variables on different y scales and a common x scale. Zoom and pan events in the x-direction are synchronized across plots."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/economics.svg")
```

Conceptually, `subplot()` provides a way to place a collection of plots into a table with a given number of rows and columns. The number of rows (and, by consequence, the number of columns) is specified via the `nrows` argument. By default each row/column shares an equal proportion of the overall height/width, but as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:proportions) the default can be changed via the `heights` and `widths` arguments.

```{r proportions, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A visual diagram of controling the `heights` of rows and `widths` of columns. In this particular example, there are 5 plots being placed in 2 rows and three columns.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/proportions.svg")
```

This flexibility is quite useful for a number of visualizations, for example, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:joint), a joint density plot is really of subplot of joint and marginal densities. The **heatmaply** package is great example of leveraging `subplot()` in a similar way to create interactive dendrograms [@heatmaply].

```{r, eval = FALSE, summary = "Click to show code"}
# generate 10,000 random values from correlated bi-variate normal distribution
m <- mvtnorm::rmvnorm(1e5, sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.3, 0.3, 1), nrow = 2))
x <- m[, 1]
y <- m[, 2]
s <- subplot(
  plot_ly(x = x, color = I("black")), 
  plotly_empty(), 
  plot_ly(x = x, y = y, color = I("black")) %>%
    add_histogram2dcontour(colorscale = "Viridis"), 
  plot_ly(y = y, color = I("black")),
  nrows = 2, heights = c(0.2, 0.8), widths = c(0.8, 0.2), margin = 0,
  shareX = TRUE, shareY = TRUE, titleX = FALSE, titleY = FALSE
)
layout(s, showlegend = FALSE)
```

```{r joint, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A joint density plot with synchronized axes."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joint.svg")
```

### Recursive subplots

The `subplot()` function returns a plotly object so it can be modified like any other plotly object. This effectively means that subplots work recursively (i.e., you can have subplots within subplots). This idea is useful when your desired layout doesn't conform to the table structure described in the previous section. In fact, you can think of a subplot of subplots like a spreadsheet with merged cells. Figure \@ref(fig:recursive) gives a basic example where each row of the outer-most subplot contains a different number of columns.

```{r, eval = FALSE, summary = "Click to show code"}
plotList <- function(nplots) {
  lapply(seq_len(nplots), function(x) plot_ly())
}
s1 <- subplot(plotList(6), nrows = 2, shareX = TRUE, shareY = TRUE)
s2 <- subplot(plotList(2), shareY = TRUE)
subplot(
  s1, s2, plot_ly(), nrows = 3, 
  margin = 0.04, heights = c(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)
)
```

```{r recursive, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Recursive subplots."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recursive.svg")
```

The concept is particularly useful when you want plot(s) in a given row to have different widths from plot(s) in another row. Figure \@ref(fig:map-subplot) uses this recursive behavior to place many bar charts in the first row, and a single choropleth in the second row.

```{r, eval = FALSE, summary = "Click to show code"}
# specify some map projection/options
g <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)
# create a map of population density
density <- state.x77[, "Population"] / state.x77[, "Area"]
map <- plot_geo(z = ~density, text = state.name, 
                locations = state.abb, locationmode = 'USA-states') %>%
  layout(geo = g)
# create a bunch of horizontal bar charts 
vars <- colnames(state.x77)
barcharts <- lapply(vars, function(var) {
  plot_ly(x = state.x77[, var], y = state.name) %>%
    add_bars(orientation = "h", name = var) %>%
    layout(showlegend = FALSE, hovermode = "y",
           yaxis = list(showticklabels = FALSE))
})
subplot(
  subplot(barcharts, margin = 0.01), map, 
  nrows = 2, heights = c(0.3, 0.7), margin = 0.1
)
```

```{r map-subplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Multiple bar charts of US statistics by state in a subplot with a choropleth of population density"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/map-subplot.svg")
```

### Other approaches & applications

Using `subplot()` directly is not the _only_ to create multiple views of a dataset with **plotly**. In some special cases, like scatterplot matrices and generalized pair plots, we can take advantage of some special methods designed specifically for these use cases.

#### Scatterplot matrices

The plotly.js library provides a trace specifically designed and optimized for scatterplot matrices (splom). To use it, provide numeric variables to the `dimensions` attribute of the `splom` trace type. 

```r
dims <- dplyr::select_if(iris, is.numeric)
dims <- purrr::map2(dims, names(dims), ~list(values = .x, label = .y))
plot_ly(type = "splom", dimensions = setNames(dims, NULL), showupperhalf = FALSE, diagonal = list(visible = FALSE))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Linked brushing in a scatterplot matrix of the iris dataset."}
include_vimeo("325081084")
```

See <https://plot.ly/r/splom/> for more options related to the splom trace type.

#### Generalized pairs plot

The generalized pairs plot is an extension of the scatterplot matrix to support both discrete and numeric variables [@gpp]. The `ggpairs()` function from the **GGally** package provides an interface for creating these plots via **ggplot2** [@GGally]. To implement `ggpairs()`, **GGally** introduces the notion of a matrix of **ggplot2** plot objects that it calls `ggmatrix()`. As Figure \@ref(fig:ggpairs) shows, the `ggplotly()` function has a method for converting ggmatrix objects directly:

```r
pm <- GGally::ggpairs(iris, aes(color = Species))
class(pm)
#> [1] "gg"  "ggmatrix"
ggplotly(pm)
```

```{r ggpairs, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A generalized pairs plot made via the `ggpairs()` function from the **GGally** package"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggpairs.svg")
```

As it turns out, **GGally** use `ggmatrix()` as a building block for other visualizations, like model diagnostic plots (`ggnostic()`). Sections \@ref(ggally-ggpairs) and \@ref(ggally-ggnostic) demonstrates how to leverage linked brushing in the `ggplotly()` versions of these plots.

#### Trellis displays with `subplot()`

It's true that **ggplot2**'s `facet_wrap()`/`facet_grid()` provides a simple way to create trellis displays, but for learning purposes, it can be helpful to learn how to implement a similar trellis display with `plot_ly()` and `subplot()`. Figure \@ref(fig:subplot-trellis) demonstrates one approach, which leverages `subplot()`'s ability to reposition annotations and shapes. Specifically, the `panel()` function below, which defines the visualization method to be applied to each `variable` in the `economics_long` dataset,  uses paper coordinates (i.e., graph coordinates on a normalized 0-1 scale) to place an annotation at the top-center of each panel as well as a rectangle shape behind the annotation. Note also the use of `ysizemode = 'pixel'` which gives the rectangle shape a fixed height (i.e., the reactangle height is always 16 pixels, regardless of the height of the trellis display).

```{r, eval = FALSE, summary = "Click to show code"}
library(dplyr)

panel <- . %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~value) %>%
  add_lines() %>%
  add_annotations(
    text = ~unique(variable),
    x = 0.5,
    y = 1,
    yref = "paper",
    xref = "paper",
    yanchor = "bottom",
    showarrow = FALSE,
    font = list(size = 15)
  ) %>%
  layout(
    showlegend = FALSE,
    shapes = list(
      type = "rect",
      x0 = 0,
      x1 = 1,
      xref = "paper",
      y0 = 0, 
      y1 = 16,
      yanchor = 1,
      yref = "paper",
      ysizemode = "pixel",
      fillcolor = toRGB("gray80"),
      line = list(color = "transparent")
    )
  )

economics_long %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  do(p = panel(.)) %>%
  subplot(nrows = NROW(.), shareX = TRUE)
```

```{r subplot-trellis, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Creating a trellis display with `subplot()`."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/subplot-trellis.svg")
```


#### ggplot2 subplots

It's possible to combine the convenience of **ggplot2**'s `facet_wrap()`/`facet_grid()` with the more flexibile arrangement capabilities of `subplot()`. Figure \@ref(fig:ggplot2-subplots) does this to show two different views of the `economics_long` data: the left-hand column displays each variable along time while the right-hand column shows violin plots of each variable. For the implementation, each column is created through `ggplot2::facet_wrap()`, but then the trellis displays are combined with `subplot()`. In this case, **ggplot2** objects are passed directly to `subplot()`, but you can also use `ggplotly()` for finer control over the conversion of **ggplot2** to **plotly** (see also Chapter \@ref(modifying-ggplotly)) before supplying that result to `subplot()`.

```r
gg1 <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(date, value)) + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
gg2 <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(factor(1), value)) + geom_violin() +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) + 
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank())
subplot(gg1, gg2)
```

```{r ggplot2-subplots, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Arranging multiple faceted ggplot2 plots into a plotly subplot."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggplot2-subplots.svg")
```


## Arranging htmlwidgets

Since plotly objects inherit properties from an htmlwidget object, any method that works for arranging htmlwidgets also works for plotly objects. 

TODO: flexdashboard!

An **htmlwidgets** object is a collection of HTML tags, and the **htmltools** package provides some useful functions for working with HTML tags [@htmltools]. The `tagList()` function gathers multiple HTML tags into a tag list, and when printing a tag list inside of a **knitr**/**rmarkdown** document [@knitr]; [@rmarkdown], it knows to render as HTML. However, when printing via the R/RStudio console, you must use `browsable()` to render and open the tag list as a web page (otherwise, it prints the HTML tags to your R console). Those familiar with **shiny** might already be familiar with using `uiOutput()` and/or `renderUI()` to dynamically render tag lists server-side.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(100)
```

```{r multiple-htmlwidgets-fake, eval = FALSE}
library(htmltools)
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(x = rnorm(100))
# NOTE: you don't need browsable() in rmarkdown, but you do at the R prompt 
browsable(tagList(p, p))
```

```{r multiple-htmlwidgets, echo = FALSE,  fig.cap = "Printing multiple htmlwidget objects with `tagList()`. To render tag lists at the command line, wrap them in `browsable()`"}
# resort to this until this gets resolved -- https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/74
knitr::include_graphics("images/multiple-htmlwidgets.png")
```


Figure \@ref(fig:multiple-htmlwidgets) renders two plots, each in its own row spanning the width of the page, because each htmlwidget object is an HTML `<div>` tag. More often than not, it is desirable to arrange multiple plots in a given row, and there are a few ways to do that. A very flexible approach is to wrap all of your plots in a [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) (i.e., an HTML `<div>` with `display: flex` Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) property). The `tags$div()` function from **htmltools** provides a way to wrap a `<div>` around both tag lists and htmlwidget objects, and set attributes, such as `style`. As Figure \@ref(fig:flexbox) demonstrates, this approach also provides a nice way to add custom styling to the page, such as borders around each panel.

```{r flexbox-fake, eval = FALSE}
tags$div(
  style = "display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap",
  tags$div(p, style = "width: 50%; padding: 1em; border: solid;"),
  tags$div(p, style = "width: 50%; padding: 1em; border: solid;"),
  tags$div(p, style = "width: 100%; padding: 1em; border: solid;")
)
```

```{r flexbox, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Arranging multiple htmlwidgets with flexbox"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flexbox.png")
```

Another way to arrange multiple htmlwidget objects on a single page is to leverage the `fluidPage()`, `fluidRow()`, and `column()` functions from the **shiny** package.

```{r fluid-fake, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
fluidPage(
  fluidRow(p),
  fluidRow(
    column(6, p), column(6, p) 
  )
)
```

```{r fluid, echo = FALSE,  fig.cap = "Arranging multiple htmlwidgets with `fluidPage()` from the **shiny** package."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fluid.png")
```

All the arrangement approaches discussed thus far are agnostic to output format, meaning that they can be used to arrange htmlwidgets within _any_ **knitr**/**rmarkdown** document.^[Although HTML can not possibly render in a pdf or word document, **knitr** can automatically detect a non-HTML output format and embed a static image of the htmlwidget via the **webshot** package [@webshot].] If the htmlwidgets do not need to be embedded within a larger document that requires an opinionated output format, the **flexdashboard** package provides a **rmarkdown** template for generating dashboards, with a convenient syntax for arranging views [@flexdashboard].



## Navigating many views

Sometimes you have to consider way more views than you can possibly digest visually. In [Multiple linked views](#multiple-linked-views), we explore some useful techniques for implementing the popular visualization mantra from @details-on-demand: 

> "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand."

In fact, Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-corrplot) from section \@ref(scoping-events) provides an example of this mantra put into practice. The correlation matrix provides an overview of the correlation structure between all the variables, and by clicking a cell, it populates a scatterplot between those two specific variables. This works fine with tens or hundreds or variables, but once you have thousands or tens-of-thousands of variables, this technique begins to fall apart. At that point, you may be better off defining a range of correlations that you're interested in exploring, or better yet, incorporating another measure (e.g., a test statistic), then focusing on views that match a certain criteria.

@scagnostics-tukey first described the idea of using quantitative measurements of scatterplot characteristics (e.g. correlation) to help guide exploratory analysis of many variables. This idea, coined scagnostics (short for scatterplot diagnostics), has since been made explicit, and many measures have been explored, even measures specifically useful for time-series have been proposed [@Wilkinson:2005b]; [@Wilkinson:2008]; [@Wilkinson:2012]. Probably the most universally useful scagnostic is the outlying measure which helps identify projections of the data space that contain outlying observations. Of course, the idea of associating quantitative measures with a graphical display of data can be generalized to include more that just scatterplots, and in this more general case, these measures are sometimes referred to as cognostics.

The same problems and principles that inspired scagnostics has inspired work on more general divide & recombine technique(s) for working with navigating through many statistical artifacts [@divide-recombine]; [@RHIPE], including visualizations [@trelliscope]. The **trelliscope** package provides a system for computing arbitrary cognostics on each panel of a trellis display as well as an interactive graphical user interface for defining (and navigating through) interesting panels based on those cognostics [@trelliscope-pkg]. This system also allows users to define the graphical method for displaying each panel, so **plotly** graphs can easily be embedded. The **trelliscope** package is currently built upon **shiny**, but as Figure \@ref(fig:trelliscope) demonstrates, the **trelliscopejs** package provides lower-level tools that allow one to create trelliscope displays without **shiny** [@trelliscopejs].

```{r trelliscope-fake, eval = FALSE}
library(trelliscopejs)

qplot(cty, hwy, data = mpg) +
  xlim(7, 37) + ylim(9, 47) + theme_bw() +
  facet_trelliscope(
    ~ manufacturer + class, nrow = 2, ncol = 4, 
    as_plotly = TRUE, plotly_args = list(dynamicTicks = T)
  )
```

```{r trelliscope, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Using plotly within a trelliscope"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/trelliscope.png")
```
