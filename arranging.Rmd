# (PART) Combining multiple views {-}

# Arranging views

One technique essential to high-dimensional data visualization is the ability to arrange multiple views. By arranging multiple low-dimensional graphics of the same (or similar) high-dimensional data, one can put 
local summaries and patterns into a global context. When arranging multiple **plotly** objects, you have some flexibility in terms of how you arrange them: you could use `subplot()` to merge multiple **plotly** object into a single object (useful for synchronizing zoom&pan events across multiple axes), place them in separate HTML tags (Section \@ref(arranging-htmlwidgets)), or embedded in a larger system for navigating many views (Section \@ref(navigating-many-views)).

Ideally, when displaying multiple related data views, they are linked through an underlying data source to foster comparisons and enable posing of data queries [@Cook:2007uk]. Chapter \@ref(graphical-queries) shows how to build upon these methods for arranging views to link them (client-side) as well.

## Arranging plotly objects

The `subplot()` function provides a flexible interface for merging multiple **plotly** objects into a single object. It is more flexible than most trellis display frameworks (e.g., **ggplot2**'s `facet_wrap()`) as you don't have to condition on a value of common variable in each display [@trellis]. Its capabilities and interface is similar to the `grid.arrange()` function from the **gridExtra** package, which allows you to arrange multiple **grid** grobs in a single view, effectively providing a way to arrange (possibly unrelated)  **ggplot2** and/or **lattice** plots in a single view [@RCore]; [@gridExtra]; [@lattice]. Figure \@ref(fig:subplot-simple) shows the most simple way to use `subplot()` which is to directly supply plotly objects.

```r
library(plotly)
p1 <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy) %>% 
  add_lines(name = "unemploy")
p2 <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~uempmed) %>% 
  add_lines(name = "uempmed")
subplot(p1, p2)
```

```{r subplot-simple, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The most basic use of `subplot()` to merge multiple plotly objects into a single plotly object."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/subplot-simple.svg")
```

Although `subplot()` accepts an arbitrary number of plot objects, passing a _list_ of plots can save typing and redundant code when dealing with a large number of plots. Figure \@ref(fig:economics) shows one time series for each variable in the `economics` dataset and share the x-axis so that zoom/pan events are synchronized across each series:

```r
vars <- setdiff(names(economics), "date")
plots <- lapply(vars, function(var) {
  plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = as.formula(paste0("~", var))) %>%
    add_lines(name = var)
})
subplot(plots, nrows = length(plots), shareX = TRUE, titleX = FALSE)
```

```{r economics, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Five different economic variables on different y scales and a common x scale. Zoom and pan events in the x-direction are synchronized across plots."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/economics.svg")
```

Conceptually, `subplot()` provides a way to place a collection of plots into a table with a given number of rows and columns. The number of rows (and, by consequence, the number of columns) is specified via the `nrows` argument. By default each row/column shares an equal proportion of the overall height/width, but as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:proportions) the default can be changed via the `heights` and `widths` arguments.

```{r proportions, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A visual diagram of controling the `heights` of rows and `widths` of columns. In this particular example, there are 5 plots being placed in 2 rows and three columns.", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/proportions.svg")
```

This flexibility is quite useful for a number of visualizations, for example, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:joint), a joint density plot is really of subplot of joint and marginal densities. The **heatmaply** package is great example of leveraging `subplot()` in a similar way to create interactive dendrograms [@heatmaply].

```{r, eval = FALSE, summary = "Click to show code"}
# generate 10,000 random values from correlated bi-variate normal distribution
m <- mvtnorm::rmvnorm(1e5, sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.3, 0.3, 1), nrow = 2))
x <- m[, 1]
y <- m[, 2]
s <- subplot(
  plot_ly(x = x, color = I("black")), 
  plotly_empty(), 
  plot_ly(x = x, y = y, color = I("black")) %>%
    add_histogram2dcontour(colorscale = "Viridis"), 
  plot_ly(y = y, color = I("black")),
  nrows = 2, heights = c(0.2, 0.8), widths = c(0.8, 0.2), margin = 0,
  shareX = TRUE, shareY = TRUE, titleX = FALSE, titleY = FALSE
)
layout(s, showlegend = FALSE)
```

```{r joint, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A joint density plot with synchronized axes."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joint.svg")
```

### Recursive subplots

The `subplot()` function returns a plotly object so it can be modified like any other plotly object. This effectively means that subplots work recursively (i.e., you can have subplots within subplots). This idea is useful when your desired layout doesn't conform to the table structure described in the previous section. In fact, you can think of a subplot of subplots like a spreadsheet with merged cells. Figure \@ref(fig:recursive) gives a basic example where each row of the outer-most subplot contains a different number of columns.

```{r, eval = FALSE, summary = "Click to show code"}
plotList <- function(nplots) {
  lapply(seq_len(nplots), function(x) plot_ly())
}
s1 <- subplot(plotList(6), nrows = 2, shareX = TRUE, shareY = TRUE)
s2 <- subplot(plotList(2), shareY = TRUE)
subplot(
  s1, s2, plot_ly(), nrows = 3, 
  margin = 0.04, heights = c(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)
)
```

```{r recursive, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Recursive subplots."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recursive.svg")
```

The concept is particularly useful when you want plot(s) in a given row to have different widths from plot(s) in another row. Figure \@ref(fig:map-subplot) uses this recursive behavior to place many bar charts in the first row, and a single choropleth in the second row.

```{r, eval = FALSE, summary = "Click to show code"}
# specify some map projection/options
g <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)
# create a map of population density
density <- state.x77[, "Population"] / state.x77[, "Area"]
map <- plot_geo(z = ~density, text = state.name, 
                locations = state.abb, locationmode = 'USA-states') %>%
  layout(geo = g)
# create a bunch of horizontal bar charts 
vars <- colnames(state.x77)
barcharts <- lapply(vars, function(var) {
  plot_ly(x = state.x77[, var], y = state.name) %>%
    add_bars(orientation = "h", name = var) %>%
    layout(showlegend = FALSE, hovermode = "y",
           yaxis = list(showticklabels = FALSE))
})
subplot(
  subplot(barcharts, margin = 0.01), map, 
  nrows = 2, heights = c(0.3, 0.7), margin = 0.1
)
```

```{r map-subplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Multiple bar charts of US statistics by state in a subplot with a choropleth of population density"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/map-subplot.svg")
```

### Other approaches & applications

Using `subplot()` directly is not the _only_ to create multiple views of a dataset with **plotly**. In some special cases, like scatterplot matrices and generalized pair plots, we can take advantage of some special methods designed specifically for these use cases.

#### Scatterplot matrices

The plotly.js library provides a trace specifically designed and optimized for scatterplot matrices (splom). To use it, provide numeric variables to the `dimensions` attribute of the `splom` trace type. 

```r
dims <- dplyr::select_if(iris, is.numeric)
dims <- purrr::map2(dims, names(dims), ~list(values = .x, label = .y))
plot_ly(type = "splom", dimensions = setNames(dims, NULL), showupperhalf = FALSE, diagonal = list(visible = FALSE))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Linked brushing in a scatterplot matrix of the iris dataset."}
include_vimeo("325081084")
```

See <https://plot.ly/r/splom/> for more options related to the splom trace type.

#### Generalized pairs plot

The generalized pairs plot is an extension of the scatterplot matrix to support both discrete and numeric variables [@gpp]. The `ggpairs()` function from the **GGally** package provides an interface for creating these plots via **ggplot2** [@GGally]. To implement `ggpairs()`, **GGally** introduces the notion of a matrix of **ggplot2** plot objects that it calls `ggmatrix()`. As Figure \@ref(fig:ggpairs) shows, the `ggplotly()` function has a method for converting ggmatrix objects directly:

```r
pm <- GGally::ggpairs(iris, aes(color = Species))
class(pm)
#> [1] "gg"  "ggmatrix"
ggplotly(pm)
```

```{r ggpairs, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A generalized pairs plot made via the `ggpairs()` function from the **GGally** package"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggpairs.svg")
```

As it turns out, **GGally** use `ggmatrix()` as a building block for other visualizations, like model diagnostic plots (`ggnostic()`). Sections \@ref(ggally-ggpairs) and \@ref(ggally-ggnostic) demonstrates how to leverage linked brushing in the `ggplotly()` versions of these plots.

#### Trellis displays with `subplot()`

It's true that **ggplot2**'s `facet_wrap()`/`facet_grid()` provides a simple way to create trellis displays, but for learning purposes, it can be helpful to learn how to implement a similar trellis display with `plot_ly()` and `subplot()`. Figure \@ref(fig:subplot-trellis) demonstrates one approach, which leverages `subplot()`'s ability to reposition annotations and shapes. Specifically, the `panel()` function below, which defines the visualization method to be applied to each `variable` in the `economics_long` dataset,  uses paper coordinates (i.e., graph coordinates on a normalized 0-1 scale) to place an annotation at the top-center of each panel as well as a rectangle shape behind the annotation. Note also the use of `ysizemode = 'pixel'` which gives the rectangle shape a fixed height (i.e., the reactangle height is always 16 pixels, regardless of the height of the trellis display).

```{r, eval = FALSE, summary = "Click to show code"}
library(dplyr)

panel <- . %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~value) %>%
  add_lines() %>%
  add_annotations(
    text = ~unique(variable),
    x = 0.5,
    y = 1,
    yref = "paper",
    xref = "paper",
    yanchor = "bottom",
    showarrow = FALSE,
    font = list(size = 15)
  ) %>%
  layout(
    showlegend = FALSE,
    shapes = list(
      type = "rect",
      x0 = 0,
      x1 = 1,
      xref = "paper",
      y0 = 0, 
      y1 = 16,
      yanchor = 1,
      yref = "paper",
      ysizemode = "pixel",
      fillcolor = toRGB("gray80"),
      line = list(color = "transparent")
    )
  )

economics_long %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  do(p = panel(.)) %>%
  subplot(nrows = NROW(.), shareX = TRUE)
```

```{r subplot-trellis, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Creating a trellis display with `subplot()`."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/subplot-trellis.svg")
```


#### ggplot2 subplots

It's possible to combine the convenience of **ggplot2**'s `facet_wrap()`/`facet_grid()` with the more flexibile arrangement capabilities of `subplot()`. Figure \@ref(fig:ggplot2-subplots) does this to show two different views of the `economics_long` data: the left-hand column displays each variable along time while the right-hand column shows violin plots of each variable. For the implementation, each column is created through `ggplot2::facet_wrap()`, but then the trellis displays are combined with `subplot()`. In this case, **ggplot2** objects are passed directly to `subplot()`, but you can also use `ggplotly()` for finer control over the conversion of **ggplot2** to **plotly** (see also Chapter \@ref(modifying-ggplotly)) before supplying that result to `subplot()`.

```r
gg1 <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(date, value)) + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
gg2 <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(factor(1), value)) + geom_violin() +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) + 
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank())
subplot(gg1, gg2)
```

```{r ggplot2-subplots, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Arranging multiple faceted ggplot2 plots into a plotly subplot."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggplot2-subplots.svg")
```


## Arranging htmlwidgets

Since **plotly** objects are also **htmlwidgets**, any method that works for arranging **htmlwidgets** also works for **plotly** objects. Moreover, since **htmlwidgets** are also **htmltools** tags, any method that works for arranging **htmltools** tags also works for **htmlwidgets**. Here are three common ways to arrange components (e.g., **htmlwidgets**, **htmltools** tags, etc) in a single web-page:

1. __flexdashboard__: An R package for arranging components into an opinionated dashboard layout. This package is essentially a special **rmarkdown** template that uses a simple markup syntax to define the layout.
2. Bootstrap's grid layout: Both the **crosstalk** and **shiny** packages provide ways to arrange numerous components via Bootstrap's (a popular HTML/CSS framework) [grid layout system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/).
3. CSS flexbox: If you know some HTML and CSS, you can leverage [CSS flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to arrange components via the **htmltools** package.

Although **flexdashboard** is a really excellent way to arrange web-based content generated from R, it can pay-off to know the other two approaches as their arrangement techniques are agnostic to an **rmarkdown** output format. In other words, approaches 2-3 can be used with used with any **rmarkdown** template^[Although HTML can not possibly render in a pdf or word document, **knitr** can automatically detect a non-HTML output format and embed a static image of the htmlwidget via the **webshot** package [@webshot].] or really _any_ framework for website generation. Although Bootstrap grid layout system (2) is expressive and intuitive, using it in a larger website that also uses a different HTML/CSS framework (e.g. Bulma, Skeleton, etc) can cause issues. In that case, CSS flexbox (3) is a light-weight (i.e., no external CSS/JS dependencies) alternative that is less likely to introduce undesirable side-effects.

### Flexdashboard

Figure \@ref(fig:flexdashboard-ggplotly) provides an example of embedding `ggplotly()` inside **flexdashboard** [@flexdashboard]. Since **flexdashboard** is an **rmarkdown** template, it automatically comes with many of things that make **rmarkdown** great: ability to produce standalone HTML, integration with other languages, and thoughtful integration with RStudio products like Connect. There are many other things to like about **flexdashboard**, including lots of easy-to-use theming options, multiple pages, storyboards, and even **shiny** integration. Explaining how the **flexdashboard** package actually works is beyond the scope of this book, but you can visit the website for documentation and more examples <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/>.

```{r flexdashboard-ggplotly, echo = FALSE, fig.link="https://plotly-r.com/flexdashboard.html", fig.cap = "An example of embedding `ggplotly()` graphs inside **flexdashboard**. See here for the interactive dashboard <https://plotly-r.com/flexdashboard.html>"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flexdashboard.png")
```

### Bootstrap grid layout

If you're already familiar with **shiny**, you may already be familiar with functions like `fluidPage()`, `fluidRow()`, and `column()`. These R functions provide an interface from R to bootstrap's grid layout system. That layout system is based on the notion of rows and columns where each row spans a width of 12 columns. Figure \@ref(fig:fluid) demonstrates how one can use these functions to produce a standalone HTML page with three **plotly** graphs -- with the first plot in the first row spanning the full width and the other 2 plots in the second row of equal width. To learn more about this `fluidPage()` approach to layouts, see <https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html>.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(100)
```

```r
library(shiny)
p <- plot_ly(x = rnorm(100))
fluidPage(
  fluidRow(p),
  fluidRow(
    column(6, p), column(6, p) 
  )
)
```

```{r fluid, echo = FALSE,  fig.cap = "Arranging multiple htmlwidgets with `fluidPage()` from the **shiny** package."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fluid.png")
```

It's also worth noting another, somewhat similar, yet more succinct, interface to grid's layout system provided by the `bscols()` function from the **crosstalk** package. You can think of it in a similar way to `fluidRow()`, but instead of defining `column()` width for each component individually, you can specify the width of several components at once through the `widths` argument. Also, importantly, this functions works recursively -- it returns a collection of **htmltools** tags and accepts them as input as well. The code below produces the same result as above, but is a much more succinct way of doing so.

```r
bscols(p, bscols(p, p), widths = 12)
```

Bootstrap is much more than just it's grid layout system, so beware -- using either of these approaches will impose Bootstrap's styling rules on other content in your webpage. If you are using another CSS framework for styling or just want to reduce the size of dependencies in your webpage, consider working with CSS flexbox instead of Bootstrap.

### CSS flexbox

Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) flexbox is a relatively new CSS feature that most modern web browsers natively support.^[For a full reference of which browsers/versions support flexbox, see <https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox>.] It aims to provide a general system for distributing space among multiple components in a container. Instead of covering this entire system, we'll cover it's basic functionality, which is fairly similar to Bootstrap's grid layout system. 

Creating a flexbox requires a flexbox container -- in HTML speak, that means a `<div>` tag with a CSS style property of `display: flex`. By default, in this display setting, all the components inside that container will try fit in a single row. To allow 'overflowing' components the freedom to 'wrap' into new row(s), set the CSS property of `flex-wrap: wrap` in the parent container. Another useful CSS property to know about for the 'parent' container is `justify-content`: in the case of Figure \@ref(fig:flexbox), I'm using it to horizontally `center` the components. Moreover, since I've imposed a width of 40% for the first two plots, the net effect is that we have 2 plots in the first two (spanning 80% of the page width), then the third plot wraps onto a new line.

```r
library(htmltools)
p <- plot_ly(x = rnorm(100))
# NOTE: you don't need browsable() in rmarkdown, but you do at the R prompt 
browsable(div(
  style = "display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center",
  div(p, style = "width: 40%; border: solid;"),
  div(p, style = "width: 40%; border: solid;"),
  div(p, style = "width: 100%; border: solid;")
))
```

```{r flexbox, echo = FALSE,  fig.cap = "Arranging multiple htmlwidgets with CSS flexbox."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/flexbox.png")
```

From the code example in Figure \@ref(fig:flexbox), you might notice that `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap` is quite similar to Bootstrap grid layout system. The main difference is that, instead of specifying widths in terms of 12 columns, you have more flexibility with how to size things, as well as how you handle extra space. Here, in Figure \@ref(fig:flexbox) I've used widths that are relative to the page width, but you could also use fixed widths (using fixed widths, however, is generally frowned upon). For those that would like to learn about more details about CSS flexbox, see <https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/>.


## Navigating many views

Sometimes you have to consider way more views than you can possibly digest visually. In Chapters \@ref(graphical-queries) and \@ref(linking-server-side), we explore some useful techniques for implementing the popular visualization mantra from @details-on-demand: 

> "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand."

In fact, Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-corrplot) from section \@ref(scoping-events) provides an example of this mantra put into practice. The correlation matrix provides an overview of the correlation structure between all the variables, and by clicking a cell, it populates a scatterplot between those two specific variables. This works fine with tens or hundreds or variables, but once you have thousands or tens-of-thousands of variables, this technique begins to fall apart. At that point, you may be better off defining a range of correlations that you're interested in exploring, or better yet, incorporating another measure (e.g., a test statistic), then focusing on views that match a certain criteria.

@scagnostics-tukey first described the idea of using quantitative measurements of scatterplot characteristics (e.g. correlation) to help guide exploratory analysis of many variables. This idea, coined scagnostics (short for scatterplot diagnostics), has since been made explicit, and many measures have been explored, even measures specifically useful for time-series have been proposed [@Wilkinson:2005b]; [@Wilkinson:2008]; [@Wilkinson:2012]. Probably the most universally useful scagnostic is the outlying measure which helps identify projections of the data space that contain outlying observations. Of course, the idea of associating quantitative measures with a graphical display of data can be generalized to include more that just scatterplots, and in this more general case, these measures are sometimes referred to as cognostics.

The same problems and principles that inspired scagnostics has inspired work on more general divide & recombine technique(s) for working with navigating through many statistical artifacts [@divide-recombine]; [@RHIPE], including visualizations [@trelliscope]. The **trelliscope** package provides a system for computing arbitrary cognostics on each panel of a trellis display as well as an interactive graphical user interface for defining (and navigating through) interesting panels based on those cognostics [@trelliscope-pkg]. This system also allows users to define the graphical method for displaying each panel, so **plotly** graphs can easily be embedded. The **trelliscope** package is currently built upon **shiny**, but as Figure \@ref(fig:trelliscope) demonstrates, the **trelliscopejs** package provides lower-level tools that allow one to create trelliscope displays without **shiny** [@trelliscopejs].

```{r trelliscope-fake, eval = FALSE}
library(trelliscopejs)

qplot(cty, hwy, data = mpg) +
  xlim(7, 37) + ylim(9, 47) + theme_bw() +
  facet_trelliscope(
    ~ manufacturer + class, nrow = 2, ncol = 4, 
    as_plotly = TRUE, plotly_args = list(dynamicTicks = T)
  )
```

```{r trelliscope, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Using plotly within a trelliscope"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/trelliscope.png")
```
